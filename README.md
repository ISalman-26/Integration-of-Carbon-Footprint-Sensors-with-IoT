# Overview 

This project demonstrates how to interface a carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor with an Arduino Nano BLE 33 using the I2C communication protocol. The CO2 sensor used in this project provides accurate readings of carbon dioxide levels in the surrounding environment, making it suitable for various applications such as indoor air quality monitoring and more.
